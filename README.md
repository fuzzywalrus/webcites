# Web&lt;cite>
a dependency free, ultra-lightweight, easy to use javascript citation list creator, inspired by Wikipedia.

## Why?

This project started out while writing an article for a company blog using web sites as sources. HTML5 (now just ol' HTML) spec includes the `<cite>` tag but it's not very useful as a list of references/citations becomes pretty unwildly as one edits an article. This brings sanity as each citation can be posted at the point in the article includes. 

When I glanced at other libraries, they were capable of doing full bibliographical citations in the various academic formats like AMA, Chicago, JM  and so on, like citeproc-js, or requiring additional JSON to be included, all powerful and useful but wanton overkill for my meager needs of my employer's blog and my own personal blog.

I didn't see a simplistic solution so I wrote one.

## Current Features (the manifesto)

* Generate a list from all the citations found within the article.
* Detect multiple instances of the same source.
* Number each `<cite>` instance, if used before, use the previous instance's number.
* Uses anchor tags to link to the source at the bottom of the page to a specificatied div
* No jQuery
* Very easy to use
  
## Planned Features

* Code fixes and some basic error checking
* MORE DOCUMENTATION!
* Demo files
* ES5 & ES6 variants
* Author (optional)
* Repository contains minified distribution ready code
* Multiple citiation lists on the same page (multi-article support)
* Optional demo Scss/CSS stylings 
* Generate as an ordered list instead of spans

## completed
* ~~Source Title (optional)~~
* ~~Date Retreived (optional)~~
* ~~Arguments passed in as object for better configuration~~
* ~~CSS attributes for each property so lists can easily customized~~
* ~~Date Retrieved vs Article Date published~~

## Maybe features

* Auto-Initalization (Just link/bundle the JS and script auto inits with defaults)
* Hover support
* Non-Web citations
* Custom Domain?


## Usage

Currently, the JS file can be linked or bundled with your current JS.  

Citations use  with multiple data values:

`<cite data-source=""data-title=""></cite>`

**source:** This is the URL and is **required**.
**title:** This is the name that article is **required**
**date:** Optional (accepts string)
**sourcename:** Optional (accepts string)
**dateretreived:**  Optional (accepts string)a


### Example of filled out tag

`<cite data-source="https://www.cnet.com/news/netscape-cuts-prices-on-retail-products" data-date="01/30/98" data-title=" Netscape cuts prices on retail products" data-sourcename="Cnet.com" data-dateretrieved="11/01/18"></cite>`

### Initializing the Script

Currently, webcites requires the script to be initialized.

`citer.init();`

### Configuration


#### target 
Accepts a string, used for the citiation list. 

By default looks for a div with the id tag of `#citations`. To change the the target you need to pass in an object:

```
citer.init({
  target: ".mydestination"
}); 
```



####  citicon 
Accepts a string, can use HTML or a Unicode/HTML code  

The default link uses a triangle â–² (html code &#9650;) but this can be switched to your own HTML or another unicode:

Example:

```
citer.init({
  target: ".mydestination",
  citicon: "<img src='/src/myicon.png'>"
}); 
```
